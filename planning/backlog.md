# Backlog

The project backlog represents a collection of the various needs of a
user/customer. These needs are then transformed into a prioritized list of work
for the development team to work through.

For this project, three priority levels were distinguished i.e.,
**_Must-Haves_**, **_Should-Haves_** and, **_Could-Haves_** as further discussed
below.

## Must-Haves

are necessary for basic usability:

### Logo

- [ ] As an customer I can find the logo of the page

> There is a suitable logo with correct image with the main name of the page.

### Title of the page

- [ ] As an customer I can find the title of the page

> There's is a clear title centrally positioned in the landing page

### Main content

- [ ] As an customer I can easily tell what the page is all about

> the story. The website also captures a vibrant themes which gives it better
> look.

- [ ] As an customer I can easily find the main content of the website

> There is a clear differentiation between the header and nav, main content, and
> footer sections

## Should-Haves

will complete the user experience, but are not necessary:

### Main information

- [ ] As a customer I can find appropriate information about hair salons which
      is relevant and some describing images.

> The main content provides information about hair salons as well as links to
> further resources available online

- [ ] As an customer I can easily read and visually appreciate the contents of
      the website

> The styling of the website is such that it is visually appealing with nicely
> spaced out content.

### Navigation bar

- [ ] As an customer I can navigate through the different content elements

> There's is a navigation bar with relevant links to different sections of the
> website

### Shops link

- [ ] As an customer I can click on the photo link and it will show me the
      necessary content.

> There is a hoto with descriptions in order to convey more information about
> the content.

## Could-Haves

would be really cool to add animation if there's time:
